hofstadter-sequences
====================

A Common LISP library for the Hofstadter Sequences. Predictably enough, you can find a simple definition of those here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter_sequence

This project is intended:
a) As a LISP learning exercise for me (and any interested fellow);
b) With entertaining purposes (I'm not a software developer in the I-do-this-9-to-5-each-day sense anymore, but I still love hacking and cursing late at night in front of a keyboard;
c) To help spreading dr. Douglas Richard Hofstadter beautiful work among the youngsters.

This is by no means serious stuff: please enjoy it for what it is, feel free to contribute to it and/or criticize it at will.
